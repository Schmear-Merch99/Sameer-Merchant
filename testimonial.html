                "Sameer tutored me in the fall of 2021 for ECE 81 or Lehigh’s Circuits
                1 class. At the time I struggled to understand concepts such as phasor
                and Laplace transformations. Sameer’s tutoring style was very dynamic,
                and he was able to cater how he taught me those concepts in a way that
                I understood. After many sessions, I was able to do both
                transformations with much more ease. Similarly, Sameer provided great
                insights and tricks for the general analysis of circuits. At the
                beginning of our tutoring sessions, he noticed that I always preferred
                to do nodal analysis instead of mesh current analysis which was
                essential to the foundations of the circuits class. He worked
                tirelessly with me for 2 weeks to solidify my ability to analyze
                circuits using the mesh current method. Sameer was an invaluable asset
                and allowed me to pass the course with a good grade." - Artur P, Electrical Engineering

                "Having Sameer as a tutor for MATH 205 was a extremely helpful experience. He was able to 
                provide excellent explanations and explained step by step solutions to problems that I didn't quite understand. 
                He allowed me to learn on my own and gave tips to solving problems without directly giving me the solution so that 
                I could fundamentally understand the problem at hand. At the end of the semester, I had asked him to help me review 
                for the final and he was able to go over every topic that the exam may cover. Received a great grade and would come 
                to him again." -Tyler N, Linear Methods

                "Sameer and Eric are both fantastic tutors who went above and beyond to help me learn. They molded to my learning style, 
                and were completely prepared for every session. Sameer runs a very professional business, and I would recommend them 
                to anyone!" -Charlotte, Calculus 1 and Chemistry
