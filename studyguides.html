    <h1>Study Guides</h1>
    <h3>I am currently making study guides for the subjects I am tutoring. This allows me to be a more effective tutor, and also serves as a supplement for students. I believe that the best way to do well on math exams is understanding the process of solving various types of problems, which in large part, is why I started making these study guides. I also make study guides on understanding some of the underlying theories behind the math for those students that want to learn more.     </h3>
