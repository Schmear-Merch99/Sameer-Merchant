      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’d describe myself as a lifelong learner who has seen different learning methods and found what works for me. I was not always this way, and in fact, it was not until my junior year at Lehigh that I started to love learning. I have been both one of the worst students, and one of the best students in my college classes so I understand how it feels to get a bad grade in a class. That being said, I am in a place in my academic career where my trajectory has generally been upwards as I have started to become more involved on campus while maintaining good grades. I am president of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and I was recently inducted in IEEE’s honor society, Eta Kappa Nu (HKN). My hobbies include beatboxing, playing violin, and working out, which are part of my love for learning.</p>
