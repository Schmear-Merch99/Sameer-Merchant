        <h2>Eric Lai</h2>
        <p>
        I’m Eric Lai, currently a senior pursuing a B.S. in Chemical Engineering at Lehigh University. Some information about me: I am the president of the Lehigh University eSports club, I have two black belts and I’m a big foodie!

        I believe there is nothing more frustrating in academics than a professor that knows practically everything in his discipline and can’t relay even a fraction of that knowledge to his/her students. I can’t recall how many times I skipped an entire semester’s worth of classes because I found it more beneficial to learn through the textbook than through lecture-based instruction. I am interested in tutoring because I believe that your time is valuable and shouldn’t be wasted through inefficient means of learning. Learning the course material is something you should expect from any tutor, but I also want to help you develop strong study habits that will guide you to prolonged success in college.

            Eric tutors chemistry, calculus 1, material balances, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, methods, pchem, reactor design.

        <h2>Madeline Braun</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Madeline Braun and I am a third year Mechanical Engineering student at Lehigh! As a new tutor at Merchant, I look forward to forming connections with other students who are working to learn the course content as I once was. Aside from being a student, I am an RA for sophomore housing and work at the Goose deli! I enjoy listening to  music and watching Queen’s Gambit. Recognizing that some courses at Lehigh require extra attention, I am excited to be a source of help for others in their learning process.
