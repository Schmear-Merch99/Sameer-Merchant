        I’m Eric Lai, currently a senior pursuing a B.S. in Chemical Engineering at Lehigh University. Some information about me: I am the president of the Lehigh University eSports club, I have two black belts and I’m a big foodie!

        I believe there is nothing more frustrating in academics than a professor that knows practically everything in his discipline and can’t relay even a fraction of that knowledge to his/her students. I can’t recall how many times I skipped an entire semester’s worth of classes because I found it more beneficial to learn through the textbook than through lecture-based instruction. I am interested in tutoring because I believe that your time is valuable and shouldn’t be wasted through inefficient means of learning. Learning the course material is something you should expect from any tutor, but I also want to help you develop strong study habits that will guide you to prolonged success in college.
