                    Hi, my name is Sameer Merchant and I am a math tutor in the Bucks County Area. In 10th grade, I started tutoring students in math for free through my high school’s math club and at Kumon as a grader. One day, a student came to my tutoring session, and I was going over graphing sine and cosine. I quickly realized he did not know anything about the unit circle, which is important for graphing these functions without a calculator. I went over the unit circle with him and he quickly understood how to graph the two functions. This made tutoring much easier as we went over subsequent topics.

                    As I went through college as an engineering student at Lehigh University, I noticed a similar problem that I saw before where the problems that students had with math earlier made their time at college much more difficult. Moreover, students who had not taken any sort of calculus in high school found themselves struggling in “weed out” introductory math classes. I found myself helping students in college with math because of this and eventually became a tutor for my college. My experiences with tutoring led me to create Merchant Math Tutoring.

                    In the past, I have worked as a tutor and a teaching assistant for many classes including Computer Architecture, Systems Software, Linear Methods (a class on differential equations and linear algebra), and Principles of Electrical Engineering. From these experiences, I have learned about the best strategies for teaching students the material. Moreover, I am a firm believer of the idea that the purpose of a tutor is to get the student to a point where I am not necessary. In other words, I teach the student problem solving skills that students do not learn in school.

                <h2>What do I tutor?</h2>
                <p>
                    Subjects I tutor include but are not limited to SAT Math, AP Physics C: Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism, Introduction to circuits, K-12 Mathematics, AP Calculus AB and BC (Calculus 1 and 2), Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. I am prepared to tutor both online using zoom and my tablet and in person. I am currently studying at Lehigh in the Bethlehem area currently so if you are interested doing in person tutoring, my email and phone number are at the bottom of the page.
